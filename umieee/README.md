# UMIEEE Presentations

The University of Manitoba chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (UMIEEE) is a student-led group at the University of Manitoba Price Faculty of Engineering. Members come from all disciplines in the faculty including biosystems, civil, computer, electrical, and mechanical.

Workshops are presented to students on a regular basis regarding popular topics such as LaTeX and Git as well as niche topics such as semi-advanced Python language features. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dozen workshops were presented to boost membership &mdash; ensuring future chapter prosperity.

This directory includes all presentations presented at UMIEEE workshops with myself as a direct contributor to the presentation.
