# UMIEEE Presentations

The University of Manitoba Chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (UMIEEE) is a student-led group at the University of Manitoba. Members come from all displines in the faculty including biosystems, civil, computer, electrical, and mechanical.

Workshops were presented to students on a regular basis regarding popular topics such as LaTeX and Git. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of university facilities for ordinary students, a dozen workshops were presented to boost membership ensuring future chapter prosperity.

In this folder are all the presentations presented to UMIEEE attendees with myself as a direct contributor.
